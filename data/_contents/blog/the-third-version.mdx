## Greetings

Hello everyone, today I am launching the third version of my personal website. This website is built using nextjs and tailwindcss with darkmode. Of course it's open source and I'll update it as it's still a work in progress.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zekhoi/zekhoi.dev.git && cd zekhoi.dev && yarn install
```

Dont forget to modify the `site.config.js`

## Features

- Blogs (Almost ready)
- Snippets (Coming soon)
- Projects (Coming soon)
